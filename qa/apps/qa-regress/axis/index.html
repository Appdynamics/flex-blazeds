<p>Hello! <em>Welcome</em> to Apache-Axis.</p>

<p>What do you want to do today?</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="happyaxis.jsp">Validate</a>
        the local installation's configuration</li>
    <li><a href="servlet/AxisServlet">View</a>
        the list of deployed Web services</li>
    <li><a href="EchoHeaders.jws?method=list">
        Call a local endpoint</a> that list's the caller's
        http headers (or see its
        <a href="EchoHeaders.jws?wsdl">WSDL</a>). 
    <li><a href="http://xml.apache.org/axis">Visit</a>
        the Apache-Axis Home Page</li>

</ul>
To enable the disabled features, uncomment the appropriate declarations in 
WEB-INF/web.xml in the webapplication and restart it.
<hr>
If the "happyaxis" validation page returns some kind of error, it is invariably a 
configuration issue. Consult the Axis documentation for specific details
on your server, or the axis-user mailing list. Sometimes that page 
returns a jasper error: if this is the case it is related to XML parser
versions. We strongly recommend you download and install
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/">Xerces</a>
